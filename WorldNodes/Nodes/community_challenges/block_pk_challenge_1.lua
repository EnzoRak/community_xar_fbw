    --Note: Montreal Blue Key lasts 20 seconds, same with Universe, and also that specific Green Key in Starksboro. Farmhouse Yellow Key lasts 200 seconds, and Laser Genesis Lasts 60. Key to the Farmhouse lasts 30 seconds. 
    --Suggested Order: Yellow, Laser Genesis (buy nuke ammo after this), Blue, Green, Universe, Farmhouse. 
    --You only really have to speedrun with finesse after taking the Blue Key, cause you have alot of time with the Laser Genesis and Yellow Keys. Use telekinesis to pick up the starksboro key and farmhouse key. With practice I was able to get it with 4 seconds to spare on entrance back to the challenge room.
