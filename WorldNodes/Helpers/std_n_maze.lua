--I was thinking that I would be able to use one larger chunk, possibally a megachunk, to contain up to 3 additional whole sized chunks of teleporters, which travel in between each of the chunks, across the kilochunk size, (path editing), which is different from how the other 4d maze one works, which is concentric. (maze segments in maze segments) vs (maze segments adjacent to maze segments.)
--with this Maybe we can go all the way to much higher dimensional mzes, just keep going back up the path and editing those. 
--and also, I kind of need to be able to procedurally generate the specific maze segment I wans, just from the input seed and relative coordinates, otherwise it will take so long to generate each section of the maze, even with the string method, that it just isn't worth it to do it at all.
