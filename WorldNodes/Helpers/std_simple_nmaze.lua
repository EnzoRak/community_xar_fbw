--I think I have figured it out. Each chunk can have an associated small, one-chunk 7x7x7 generation maze vertices based maze, and also a 3 dimensional teleporter based maze of max size 16x16x16. 
--When we call a maze of the finest level, we generate the one chunk maze. Then, we use the parent chunk's teleporter maze generation to determine which parent chunk's adjacent chunk to go to, and place the teleporter in a random sub-room in the finest chunk. 
--We can keep doing this, quite possibly, for every chunk that exists. 
--Loops? No, because each connection is already determined by the parent chunks. 
--Issue, the links between each parent chunk might not even exist. Therefore, the parent chunk maze generator must have parameters set before generation. In this way, we can extend a maze infinitely, but it won't be that complex at all. We simply call the seed of the parent chunk before generating the maze based on the parent chunk. AND, its not one whole big thing, so we can procedurally generate more sub-mazes procedurally and it won't be slow. This is what could make it infinite. An infinite dimensional maze. However, the teleporter blocks must behave diferently. 
--An additional benefit of doing tit this way. We can have small micro dungeon mazes that are not of the same type as other ones. We could litterlaly put timed events in the maze and it would still be fine.
